# DrawingReferences
Generates references for artists

## Repository
https://github.com/Nat-Huang/DrawingReferences.git

## Description
My program will generate a reference that an artist may need, including the human body (male and female), a few animals, objects, buildings, etc. They will also be able to request these images to be flipped, on the grayscale, and/or a jpg or png file.

## Demonstration Video

## Features
- Provide a total of 10-15 images with an option to randomnize
	- Import pillow, random, and image
    - Map the images to correspond with one another 
    - Print the list of the categories and include if/else statements
- Change to be flipped, grayscale, and the jpg/png
	- Include if/else statements for each one.
    - In the def there's going to be questionare the person would have to fill out with "yes" or "no" answers on whether or not they want something done to their reference image.
- Possible option to change resolution of images and/or giving an option to select more than one image at once
	- Include an option to resize and then the program resizes it in script.
    - Need to look more into it

## Challenges
- Keeping everything organzied and make sure I don't confuse any if/else statements with each other
- Making sure every single component in changing a reference image works and that all combinations are possible together

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideal outcome are the many possible references combinations someone could ask for, including all motifications

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Make sure to get all of the images imported so the person using the program would at least get the images they want to see. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Compile all images used for references (mostlikely stock)
  2. Write the basic components of the script and importing them images (i.e. mapping)

- Week 2
  1. Adding more script for the other components such as flipping the canvas, grayscale, and the png/jpg files
  2. Test

- Week N (Final)
  1. Add any additional features and/or images
  2. Test
